# Loading Complex Pages - The Results Page Case

As discussed in the [Code Architecture](2-CodeExecutionOverview.md) part of this tutorial, implementing a LITW study is basically implementing a set of HTML templates and adding them to a timeline.
Up to this point, though, we have only worked with static templates, meaning, HTML pages that are fully defined at "coding time".
There are though, some complex pages, that you may want to change depending on some specific data that was produced on "participantion time."
For example, you may want to think that, if a participant said they are from a specific country, you want to show a flag of that nation in a page.

In this tutorial, we will see how to implement such dynamic pages.
